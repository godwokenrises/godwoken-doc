This tutorial assumes users have already downloaded a web3 wallet, such as MetaMask, and that users have CKB or tokens in the wallet.

Visit [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to download the wallet. For more information about the concepts of Godwoken and CKB, refer to [Nervos CKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/introduction) and [Godwoken](https://docs.godwoken.io). 

## Deposit CKB or Supported sUDT from Layer 1 to Layer 2 wallet

1. Add the Godwoken Network manually to the MetaMask wallet.  

 Godwoken v1 is currently in active development. For more information on Godwoken public networks, see [godwoken](https://github.com/godwokenrises/godwoken-info).


2. Bridge Your Own Assets

 Login to the bridge with user's own MetaMask wallet, and connect to the Godwoken Network.

 **Note:** The minimum amount of deposit from Layer 1 to Layer 2 is 400 CKB.

## Withdraw Assets from Godwoken v0 to Godwoken v1

In the [Godwoken Bridge Withdrawal UI](https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io/#/v0), choose the destination that you want to move the assets into, then click `Request Withdrawal` and `Confirm` to complete the transaction.

 **Note:** Withdrawing assets from Layer 0 to Layer 1 has a withdrawal period of at least 5 days, which means that the user will have to wait at least 5 days until receiving the assets.
