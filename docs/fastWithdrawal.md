This tutorial shows how to deposit and withdraw funds from old Godwoken - version 0 - to the new network - version 1. If you don't have any funds on old network you should skip this article.
:::

This guide will show you how to do Fast Withdrawal, which takes minutes instead of days and transfer funds from old Layer 2 EVM Godwoken network to the new Godwoken.

If you wish to withdraw funds from Godwoken V0 to Nervos Layer 1 then it will be a slower process (days) due to Optimistic Rollup security architecture. 

In order to follow this tutorial, you must have already downloaded a web3 wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), and have enough CKB or supported sUDT tokens in the wallet.

For more information about the concepts of CKB, refer to [Nervos CKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/introduction).

## Prerequisites

- Set up an account in MetaMask.

- Connect [Godwoken Bridge](https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/) with the MetaMask wallet and switch the network to **Godwoken Testnet v1.1**.

- Acquire CKB for your layer 1 wallet from [CKB Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.nervos.org/). The **L1 Wallet address** can be found on the Deposit page of Godwoken Bridge.

  **Note:** A deposit or a withdrawal requires at least 400 CKB.

## Deposit CKB from Nervos CKB to MetaMask

**Note:** The minimum amount of a deposit from Nervos CKB layer 1 to MetaMask is 400 CKB.

To deposit CKB from Nervos CKB to MetaMask:
