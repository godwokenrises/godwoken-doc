Godwoken-Kicker deployment requires the following accounts:

- CKB Miner
- CKB Faucet
- Deployer of Rollup Genesis Cells
- Deployer of Rollup Scripts
- Godwoken Block Producer

All the accounts used in Godwoken-Kicker have their privkeys located in the `. /accounts/` directory, CKB genesis blocks pre-issued large amounts of CKBs for these accounts. The following describes the usage and occurrence of the accounts used in Godwoken-Kicker. For more information, refer to [CKB chain specs](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/docker/layer1/ckb/specs/dev.toml). 

```bash
$ cd godwoken-kicker
$ ls -1 accounts
ckb-miner-and-faucet.key
godwoken-block-producer.key
README.md
rollup-genesis-cell-deployer.key
rollup-scripts-deployer.key

$ ckb-cli util key-info --privkey-path accounts/godwoken-block-producer.key

```

Note that using one key for everything is possible but will cause confusion and complicate debugging.

## CKB Miner

The CKB miner account is identified by the CKB miner key that can be used to unlock the block cellbase. The corresponding public key is configured in [`block_assembler`](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/docker/layer1/ckb/ckb.toml#L143-L147) inside [ckb.toml](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/docker/layer1/ckb/ckb.toml) of the CKB base directory.

# Set the lock script to protect mined CKB.

# CKB uses CS architecture for miner. Miner process (ckb miner) gets block
# template from the Node process (ckb run) via RPC. Thus the lock script is
# configured in ckb.toml instead of ckb-miner.toml, and the config takes effect
# after restarting Node process.
#
# The `code_hash` identifies different cryptography algorithm. Read the manual
# of the lock script provider about how to generate this config.
#
# CKB provides an secp256k1 implementation, it requires a hash on the
# compressed public key. The hash algorithm is blake2b, with personal
# "ckb-default-hash". The first 160 bits (20 bytes) are used as the only arg.
#
# You can use any tool you trust to generate a Bitcoin private key and public
# key pair, which can be used in CKB as well. CKB CLI provides the function for
# you to convert the public key into block assembler configuration parameters.
#
# Here is an example using ckb-cli to generate an account, this command will
# print the block assembler args(lock_arg) to screen:
#
#     ckb-cli account new
#
# If you already have a raw secp256k1 private key, you can get the lock_arg by:
#
#     ckb-cli util key-info --privkey-path <privkey-path>
#
# The command `ckb init` also accepts options to generate the block assembler
# directly. See `ckb init --help` for details.
#
#     ckb init <lock_arg>

## CKB Faucet

The CKB faucet account uses the same key as the CKB miner account. When executing `./kicker deposit`, the CKB faucet account transfers a certain amount of CKBs to a given address and deposits them into layer 2 (Godwoken).

## [Deployer of Rollup Genesis Cells](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/accounts/godwoken-block-producer.key)

This account deploys the rollup genesis cells on layer 1. When setting up the rollup genesis cells on layer 1, `gw-tools deploy-genesis` uses `[Omnilock](https://blog.cryptape.com/omnilock-a-universal-lock-that-powers-interoperability-1)` to [record the public key](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken/blob/c18807b5cfaa961c230e15e3a381570c324db6f8/crates/tools/src/deploy_genesis.rs#L428-L448).

## [Deployer of Rollup Scripts](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/accounts/rollup-scripts-deployer.key)

This account is used by `gw-tools deploy-scripts` to deploy rollup-related scripts to layer 1. The account will deactivated later on. 

## [Godwoken Block Producer](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-kicker/blob/compatibility-changes/accounts/godwoken-block-producer.key)

The following configuration provides more information about this account:

```bash
[block_producer.wallet_config]
privkey_path = '/godwoken-block-producer.key'

[block_producer.wallet_config.lock]
code_hash = '0x9bd7e06f3ecf4be0f2fcd2188b23f1b9fcc88e5d4b65a8637b17723bbda3cce8'
