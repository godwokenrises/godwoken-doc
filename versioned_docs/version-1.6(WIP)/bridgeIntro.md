[Godwoken Bridge](https://testnet.bridge.godwoken.io/#/v1/) functions as a token bridge between CKB and Godwoken and allows the quick deposit and withdrawal of assets. It is powered by [Light Godwoken](https://github.com/zhangyouxin/light-godwoken), an SDK dedicated to developing decentralized applications on Godwoken.

In contrast to the previous version, the current version of Godwoken Bridge offers:
- A unified deposit/withdraw page;
- Quick asset withdrawal from Godwoken v0 to v1.
