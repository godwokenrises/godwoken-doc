The following content covers the most recent changes in Godwoken Web3 v1.6. For the full release notes refer to [Godwoken Web3 Releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/releases).

The latest update to Godwoken Web3 v1.6 includes the following changes:

### Added

- feat: add NewRelic instruments in [#444](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/444)

  This PR adds NewRelic instruments for:
    - Postgres
    - Redis
    - Godwoken RPC client
    - HTTP interfaces

- feat: add optional Prof rpc in [#447](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/447)

   This PR added Prof RPC module to enable quick debugging on the local environment. Only with `ENABLE_PROF_RPC=true` will allow such a module, like ckb:
    - `prof_cpu` to debug CPU profiling
    - `prof_heap` to debug memory usage/ memory leak
    
 Note: Related PR can be viewed at [#444](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/444), which added NewRelic to watch for perf on web3.

- feat: disallow meta contract tx, add parser tooling in [#454](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/454)
- feat: add blockSpecifer for blockParameter to support Eip1898 in [#476](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/476)
- apply rate limit to ws in [#452](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/452)
- perf(web3-indexer): Store block faster in [#414](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/414)

  This PR aimed at fetching and storing transactions & logs in batch, which can be faster if the block has many transactions and logs.

### Fixed

- fix: Get transaction from fullnode if readonly node returns null in [#469](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/469)

- fix(indexer): dockerfile install libcurl4 in [#485](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/485)

- fix: handle error for vm max cycle exceed in [#486](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/486)

- fix(indexer): Retry when tx receipt not found in [#488](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/488)

  This PR fixed the issue that the web3 indexer cannot receive the receipt and then failed. After fixing, it will retry for 10 times and wait for ~55s approx, or exit with an error if it still not found.

- fix: `gw_submit_l2transaction` support auto create account tx in [#498](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/498)

- Fix log transaction index in [#502](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/pull/502)

  This PR fixed the issue that [`eth_getTransactionReceipt` 's transactionIndex was inconsistent with `log.transactionIndex`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-web3/issues/495). `log.transaction_index` was always zero when indexed after version v1.6.0-rc1. You need to consider re-async database from scratch, or use the provided CLI tool to correct the wrong data.

  **To use the provided CLI tool**

  ```
  // Get count, database-url can also read from env
  yarn run cli wrong-log-transaction-index-count -d <database url>
   yarn run cli wrong-log-transaction-index-count --help // for more info
  
  // Fix wrong data
  // database-url can also read from env
  yarn run cli fix-log-transaction-index -d <database url>
  yarn run cli fix-log-transaction-index --help // for more info
  ```
